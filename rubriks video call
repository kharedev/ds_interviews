Questions:

'''
There are n VM’s which make up an App, these VM’s are there on your local datacenter and you have to upload them to 
cloud to get your app up. There is a limited amount of bandwidth available to upload these VM’s. 
And these VM’s have a priority Order to boot up after they are uploaded,
how would you upload these VM’s so that the App can come up in minimum time.
'''

Assumptions: 
1. All vm sizes are given initially.
2. For bandwidth measurement we should know that how much is the maximum threshold size is required 
so as not to cog the network.


Approach: 
1. Find the list of vms with sorted sizes in ascending order.
2. To make the efficient use of bandwidth , we will group the vm's in bunch whos size sum is cumulative to the maximum 
threshold.
3. After making the group of vms, we will upload them
